From the start, she was incredibly vocal and affectionate- although still very cautious and timid around strangers.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough very vocal, she doesn’t have a proper “meow”. Instead, she has a whole vocabulary of “chirps”, “squeaks”, and the occasional high-pitched sustained “SQUEEE!”.\nCoda strictly enforces a bedtime for the house- crying insistently if everyone isn’t settled into the bedroom by midnight.\nSince discovering her love of diced cucumbers, she now assumes anything being chopped in the kitchen must be cucumbers and will beg relentlessly until she’s shown—and convinced—that it’s something else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA scrawny Coda her first month in her new home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoda enjoys the sunshine while harshly judging the neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n\nHanging out with her dad."
