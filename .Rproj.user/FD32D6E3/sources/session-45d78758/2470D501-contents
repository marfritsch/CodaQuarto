## A bit about her..

Originally from Texas, Coda was adopted from Fort Collins' *Animal Friends Alliance* in January 2023. Though she was a full-grown two-year-old cat, she weighed only 5 pounds. From the start, she was incredibly vocal and affectionate- although still very cautious and timid around strangers.

## Some quirks..

-   Although very vocal, she doesn't have a proper "meow". Instead, she has a whole vocabulary of "chirps", "squeaks", and the occasional high-pitched sustained "SQUEEE!".

-   Coda strictly enforces a bedtime for the house- crying insistently if everyone isn't settled into the bedroom by midnight.

-   Since discovering her love of diced cucumbers, she now assumes anything being chopped in the kitchen must be cucumbers and will beg relentlessly until she’s shown—and convinced—that it’s something else.
